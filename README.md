# Python-199-Challenges
A comprehensive collection of 199+ Python challenges focused on logic, automation, and problem-solving. My personal journey from zero to 20,000 RPM.

# 🔱 Python Mastery: The 199 Challenges Journey 🚀

Welcome to my central command for Python development. This repository is not just code; it's the physical manifestation of **19,000 carats of logic** and a relentless pursuit of technical excellence.

## 💎 The Mission
I am documenting my evolution through **199+ intensive Python challenges**, transitioning from foundational logic to high-performance automation and backend architecture. My goal? Constant execution at **20,000 RPM**.

## 🏗️ What's Inside?
This bunker contains solutions focused on:
- **Core Logic:** Mastering data structures and algorithms.
- **Automation:** Scripts designed to eliminate "cardboard tasks" and optimize the Matrix.
- **Problem Solving:** Real-world scenarios resolved with clean, efficient code.

## 📈 Progress Status: 199/199 🏁
- [x] Phase 1: Foundations & Logic (Completed)
- [x] Phase 2: Intermediate Automation (Completed)
- [x] Phase 3: High-Fidelity Systems (In Progress/Completed)
